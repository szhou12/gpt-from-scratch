        "### Pytorch Recap\n",
        "1. `import torch.nn as nn`\n",
        "    - The `torch.nn` module contains classes and functions that are used for building neural networks in PyTorch. This includes the foundational building blocks for neural networks, such as layers (e.g., `Linear`, `Conv2d`), and modules (`Module`), which are the base class for all neural network modules.\n",
        "    - `nn` (Object-oriented API): Provides classes that allow you to encapsulate parameters and helpers in objects. This is useful for defining complex models and is typically preferred when designing architectures.\n",
        "2. `from torch.nn import functional as F`\n",
        "    - The `torch.nn.functional` module contains function versions of many of the operations and layers available in `torch.nn`.\n",
        "    - These functions include activation functions (`F.relu`, `F.sigmoid`), operations used in convolutional neural networks (`F.conv2d`, `F.max_pool2d`), and loss functions (`F.cross_entropy`), among others.\n",
        "    - Unlike the classes in `torch.nn`, which require creating an instance of the class (e.g., `layer = nn.Conv2d(...)`), functions in `torch.nn.functional` can be used directly by passing inputs and any necessary parameters (e.g., `output = F.conv2d(input, weight)`).\n",
        "    - `F` (Functional API): Provides stateless, functional alternatives to the classes in `nn`. This is useful for operations that don't require storing state (parameters), such as applying activations, performing a convolution operation with dynamically created filters, or applying a loss function directly within the model's forward method.\n",
        "3. `nn.Embedding`\n",
        "    - A PyTorch layer that's typically used to convert token indices in a vocabulary into dense vector representations (embeddings). The layer takes two main arguments: **(the number of embeddings, the dimensionality of each embedding vector)**. In most natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the dimensionality of embeddings is much smaller than the vocabulary size, facilitating efficient representation of words or tokens.\n",
        "    - Assume `vocab_size=65`, This layer (`self.token_embedding_table`) now acts as a 65x65 table where **each row corresponds to a token** and **each column to a possible next token**, **with values being the logits** (raw predictions prior to normalization).\n",
        "    - When you input an index (or indices) to this layer, it returns the corresponding row(s) (aka. channel) from the table. For instance, if the input index is 3 (for `a`), the layer returns the 4th row (0-indexed) of the table, which is a vector of size 65. Each element of this vector represents the model's logit for the probability of each vocabulary token being the next token after `a`.\n",
